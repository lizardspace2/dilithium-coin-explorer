# 🚀 Announcing Quantix (QTX): The Quantum-Resistant Blockchain 🛡️⚛️

**[Bounties Available]** **[Mining Live]** **[Mainnet Online]**

Hey r/CryptoCurrency and r/Blockchain!

We are excited to unveil **Quantix (QTX)**, a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain built from the ground up to resist the looming threat of quantum computing.

## 🛑 The Problem: Quantum Computing vs. Bitcoin
Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Experts predict that within the next decade, powerful quantum computers will be able to crack these keys using Shor's algorithm, potentially rendering today's crypto assets insecure.

## 🛡️ The Solution: Powered by Crystals-Dilithium
Quantix utilizes the **Crystals-Dilithium** signature scheme—a finalist in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition.

**Why Dilithium?** 
It relies on the hardness of finding short vectors in lattices, a problem that is believed to be secure even against quantum supercomputers. This ensures your assets remain secure not just today, but decades into the future. **Your keys are future-proof.**

### Key Features:
*   **⚛️ Quantum Secure:** Built with standard-compliant Crystals-Dilithium signatures.
*   **⚡ Fast & Scalable:** Optimized block times and transaction throughput.
*   **💎 Fair Launch:** 100M transparent pre-mine for development/faucet, with continuous block rewards.
*   **🔍 Advanced Explorer:** Check out our "Quantix Explorer" to visualize the chain in real-time.
